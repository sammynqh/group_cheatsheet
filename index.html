	<p>What an amazing cheat sheet, aaaaargh me maties</p>
	<h2>Moving around in the Command Line</h2>
	<p>The first thing you will need to get used to is moving around. Start by printing the name of the directory you are in:

$ pwd
Then have a look at whatâ€™s in that directory ( list the contents):

$ ls
To move up a directory ( change directory ) do

$ cd ..
To move back into the folder you just left do

$ cd name_of_the_folder
Your commandline will help you: tab can often be used to auto-complete names of files, the up arrow can be used to cycle through previous commands that you have typed.</p>
