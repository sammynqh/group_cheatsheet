	<h2>Moving around in the Command Line</h2>
	<p>
<br>
		The first thing you will need to get used to is moving around. Start by printing the name of the directory you are in:
<br>
$ pwd
<br>
Then have a look at what's in that directory ( list the contents):
<br>
$ ls
<br>
To move up a directory ( change directory ) do
<br>
$ cd ..
<br>
To move back into the folder you just left do
<br>
$ cd name_of_the_folder
<br>
Your commandline will help you: tab can often be used to auto-complete names of files, the up arrow can be used to cycle through previous commands that you have typed.</p>
